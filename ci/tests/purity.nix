# Purity invariant (roadmap §5, Class B): the gen-settings library source carries no nixpkgs-lib
# tether token, over the domain stated under Scope below. What this library's inputs are is
# `flake.nix`'s to declare — this suite reads that file only as source text to scan, enumerates no
# inputs, and asserts nothing about their purity. A stray `lib.`/`evalModules`/`nixpkgs` tether in
# the library source fails CI. Scope: lib/**.nix + the root flake.nix + default.nix. NOT ci/.

  # by whitespace. A `#` flush against other text is inside a string literal (`lib/display.nix` and
  # `lib/inject.nix` both render an `aspect(name#hash)` label that way), and cutting there hides
  # every character after it — code included — from the scan below. The rule this replaces cut at
  # the FIRST `#` and rested on "no `#` in a string literal", which is false in this corpus and was
  # asserted by nothing.
  #
  # Where the rule cannot tell, it KEEPS the text, and that direction is the whole point: prose
  # that gets scanned is a red CI somebody reads, code that goes unscanned is nothing at all. It
  # still cuts at a whitespace-preceded `#` inside a `''…''` block — measured absent here, and the
  # residue a full Nix lexer would close.

  # ★ THE STRIP'S PREMISE, asserted rather than assumed. `stripComments` cuts each line at a comment
  # marker, and that cut is sound only while the `#` it cuts at stands OUTSIDE a string literal.
  # Where it does not, live code is truncated to the end of that line and every cell below goes
  # blind on what was removed, with no signal at all — a green suite over source nothing scanned.
  #
  # The predicate asks the strip ITSELF where it cut: `stripComments` of a single line is exactly
  # the text before that line's cut. It then asks whether that text closed every double quote it
  # opened, an odd count meaning the cut stands inside a string. Deriving it from `stripComments`
  # rather than restating the cut rule is what keeps premise and strip from drifting apart when one
  # of them is edited, and it is why one block serves both strip families in this ecosystem.
  #
  # It is LINE-LOCAL and so cannot conclude about string content that spans lines — an indented
  # multi-line string block. Those files are declared as a list of their own by
  # `test-strip-premise-multiline-strings` rather than trusted in silence.
